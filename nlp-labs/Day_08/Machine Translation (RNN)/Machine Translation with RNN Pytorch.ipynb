    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Seq2Seq (Encoder-Decoder) Model Architecture** has become ubiquitous due to the advancement of **Transformer** Architecture in recent years. Large corporations started to train huge networks and published them to the research community. Recently Open API has licensed their most advanced pre-trained Transformer model **GPT-3** to Microsoft. Even though the practical implementation of RNN has become almost non-existent, anyone starting to learn the most advanced algorithms still need to understand how to implement a Seq2Seq Model just using RNN and its variants (LSTM, GRU). In this notebook, we are going to implement **Machine Translation using Recurrent Neural Network and PyTorch** from scratch.\n",
