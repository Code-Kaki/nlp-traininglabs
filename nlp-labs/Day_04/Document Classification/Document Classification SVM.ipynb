This is a supervised classification task, and therefore, we have a document corpus that is **pre-labelled** and we will begin by taking the training corpus and incorporating it into a Python data structure that is suitable for pre-processing and consumption via the classifier."

    "# Supervised Classifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Supervised Classifiers** are a group of **statistical machine learning techniques** that attempt to attach a \"class\", or \"label\", to a particular set of features, based on **prior known labels** attached to other similar sets of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is clearly quite an abstract definition, so it may help to have an example. Consider a set of text documents. Each document has an associated set of words, which we will call \"features\". Each of these documents might be associated with a class label that describes what the article is about.\n",

    "# Support Vector Machine\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support Vector Machines** are a subclass of supervised classifiers that attempt to partition a feature space into two or more groups, which in our case means separating a collection of articles into two or more class labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "SVMs achieve this by **finding an optimal means** of separating such groups based on their known class labels. In the simpler cases the separation **\"boundary\"** is linear, leading to groups that are split up by lines (or planes) in high-dimensional spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "In more complicated cases (where groups are not nicely separated by lines or planes), SVMs are able to carry out **non-linear partitioning**. This is achieved by means of a **kernel function**. Ultimately, this makes them very sophisticated and capable classifiers, but at the usual expense that they can be **prone to overfitting**.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the figure below for two examples of **non-linear decision boundaries** (**polynomial kernel** and **radial kernel respectively**) for two class labels (orange and blue), across two features:\n",

    "The dataset that we are using in this notebook is [Reuters-21578](http://www.daviddlewis.com/resources/testcollections/reuters21578/) which the core dataset for machine learning classification task. The set consists of a collection of **news articles (a \"corpus\")** that are tagged with a selection of topics and geographic locations. Thus it comes \"ready made\" to be used in classification tests, since it is already **pre-labelled**.\n",

This essentially reduces importance for words that appear a lot generally, as opposed to appearing a lot within a particular document.\n",

Notice that the `confusion_matrix` function takes both the `pred` predictions array and the `y_test` correct class labels to produce the matrix. In addition we create the hit-rate by providing `score` with both the `X_test` and `_test` subsets of the dataset."
